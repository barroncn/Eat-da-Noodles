# Eat-da-Pasta App

[Check it out here!](https://powerful-dawn-71781.herokuapp.com/)

This app was my first time using a Model Views Controller approach. Later, on bigger projects, I really learned to appreciate the structure! In Eat-tha-Pasta, users create different pasta dishes, then, when they are ready, they can devour the dish! The app will keep track of what they ate (in case they need to know how many miles to run later).
